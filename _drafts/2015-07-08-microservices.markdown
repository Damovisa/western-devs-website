For some time, people have been talking about microservices. I say "some time" for two reasons: 1) It's a good opening line, and 2) I have no clue how long people have been talking about them. I just heard the term for the first time about four months ago. So if I start talking about them now, I can get at least two more future posts on the subject talking about how I was doing it wrong.

In the meantime, I _have_ been talking about them quite a bit recently. We've been using them on a project at [Clear Measure](http://www.clear-measure.com) and I'd like to think it's been successful but it's too soon to tell. I feel good about what we've done which, historically, has always been a good metric for me.
