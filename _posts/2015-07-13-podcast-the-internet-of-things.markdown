####Synopsis

Is Internet of Things SCADA without the pomp and circumstance?

Security (and lack there of) in internet-enabled devices

Connecting devices together and the short-sightedness of proprietary access

Off-the-shelf vs. build-your-own

Encouraging good behaviour and learning through internet-enabled devices

Advantages (and risks) in the health industry

"See a need, fill a need": Sump pumps and coffeepots

Does the light _really_ go out when you close the fridge?

Accessibility of hardware to software people and vice versa
