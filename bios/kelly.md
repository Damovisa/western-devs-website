Kelly is the Manager of Technology Advancement at DMT Development Systems Group. What that means, basically, is that he is involved in much of the company's R&D efforts, from product review and technology oversight to product definition and prototyping. Working with both the technical and the business sides of the company, he performs many a translation duty for both sides of that equation.

Kelly has spoken at several national conferences in the past and hopes to do so again in the future, if he can tear himself away from his ever-growing comic book obsession to sit down and put together a demo deck.
