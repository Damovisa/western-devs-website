I am a manager in the technology space, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. I do a lot of focus on the mobile space as well as looking into social media, but also am heavily involved in the local .NET community as president of the local user group. I speak at technology conferences on a number of topics, including mobile, SketchFlow, and other random topics that interest me.
