David Wesst, otherwise known as "Wessty" or "DW", is a JavaScript enthusiast, currently working as an Enterprise Java Developer for the University of Manitoba.

After earning his Bachelor of Computer Science (B.C.Sc.) nearly 10 years ago, David has continued in software development, focusing primarily on rich web experience development and design. Although a fluent developer, David's strength lies in his strong communication and his ability to gather and translate requirements between both technical and business-centric teams.

DW's love for software development goes beyond the workplace, and into the community, where he has served on the [Winnipeg .NET User Group](http://winnipegdotnet.org/) for the past many years. His contributions to the Microsoft development community have resulted in being awarded the Microsoft MVP Award in the area of Internet Explorer for the past 5 years.
