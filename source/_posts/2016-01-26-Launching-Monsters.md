excerpt: We're really excited about the new ASP.NET Core and the future of ASP.NET in general. So much so that we're starting a specialty site and a bi-weekly video blog all about it.

One of the best things about the Western Devs is that we all have our own areas of interest and specialty. From time to time our interests align pretty closely and when this happens great things are produced. The [ASP.NET Monsters](http://aspnetmonsters.com/) are just such a thing. 

Some of us are really excited about ASP.NET Core so we broke off a special interest group consisting of

    </div>

We're going to be blogging a lot about how to use ASP.NET Core and we're even going to record an ongoing series of videos, twice a week, with tips and tutorials. These videos will be short 5-10 minute affairs so you can watch them in your lunch break. Head over to [ASP.NET Monsters](http://aspnetmonsters.com/) to check out what we've unleashed.
