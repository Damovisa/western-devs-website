We're thrilled to introduce our newest member, [Lori Lalonde](http://www.westerndevs.com/bios/lori_lalonde). Lori is well-known to most us through her [presentations](http://solola.ca/speaking/) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/loriblalonde). She dove right into Slack with us and you'll hear her dulcet tones shortly on our next [podcast](http://www.westerndevs.com/podcasts/).

Lori has written [two books](http://www.westerndevs.com/whatwevedone) and is a regular speaker on Xamarin and Windows Phone development. She is actively involved in the development community and is the user group leader for [Canada's Technology Triangle .NET User Group](http://meetup.com/cttdnug).

A big Western Devs Welcome&copy; to you, Lori!
