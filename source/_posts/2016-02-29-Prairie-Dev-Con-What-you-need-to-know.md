[Prairie Dev Con](http://prairiedevcon.com/) starts in just over a month. And the Western Devs will be there [in force](http://www.westerndevs.com/speaking/). No fewer than nine of us are presenting and Dylan Smith is going a step further by putting on a workshop on [How to DevOps](http://prairiedevcon.com/Workshops). And based on the [sessions](http://prairiedevcon.com/Sessions) it looks to be one of the best yet.

Being the impartial and unbiased people we are, we won't outline reasons why you should go. Instead, we'll just tell you what we love about PrDC.

I love talking at PrDC because there is always something totally new to learn about. One year it was graph databases, another year how to use EF properly and still another how to build paper airplanes. No matter what I come away with the feeling my brain is full

Prairie Dev Con was my first. The first conference I attended. The first conference I had been given the opportunity to speak at. The first conference that welcomed me as part of a broader tech community. Maybe that makes my opinion of it a little bias. Maybe not. 

The atmosphere of Prairie Dev Con is one of learning but in a fun, relaxed manner. The cost of registration is the most affordable I've seen for a 2 day conference, but the value it provides in return is tenfold. This is the type of conference that I wished was available to me throughout my career. Something that would have satisfied my desire to learn, that I could afford to attend, with or without the support of my past employers. 

What I can say for certain is that I look forward to returning to Prairie Dev Con each year, because D'Arcy Lussier - conference organizer extraordinaire - knows how to put on a good show. From development to management to dev ops, it includes sessions that are suited to anyone in the technology sector, with a top notch speaker lineup to boot (and I'm not just saying that because I'm one of them).

Presenting at PrDC has been important to me and will continue to be as long as it is around. Every time I attend I am always introduced to new concepts, new ideas, and new development communities that allow me to expand my knowledge and grow as a professional. PrDC has helped make me into the developer I am today, and I really can't imagine where I would had I not presented and attended PrDC all those years ago when it first began.
