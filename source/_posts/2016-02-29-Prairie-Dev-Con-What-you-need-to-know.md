[Prairie Dev Con](http://prairiedevcon.com/) starts in just over a month. And the Western Devs will be there [in force](http://www.westerndevs.com/speaking/). No fewer than nine of us are presenting and Dylan Smith is going a step further by putting on a workshop on [How to DevOps](http://prairiedevcon.com/Workshops). And based on the [sessions](http://prairiedevcon.com/Sessions) it looks to be one of the best yet.

Being the impartial and unbiased people we are, we won't outline reasons why you should go. Instead, we'll talk to those of us who are going and ask why they're excited to be there and what they love about PrDC.
