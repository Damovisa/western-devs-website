This one took me forever to figure out. I'm using the SqlProgrammabilityProvider from FSharp.Data.SqlClient to do some data work. However when I point the connection string at my databse it isn't able to generate any completions after Table

{% codeblock lang:powershell %}
 [<Literal>]
    let connectionString = @"Data Source=localhost\SQL2014;Initial Catalog=Completions;Integrated Security=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;Timeout=360"

    type Completions = SqlProgrammabilityProvider<connectionString>
    
    let TagExists(projectId, tagNumber) =
        let b = new Completions.dbo.Tables. //ugh, won't complete
{% endcodeblock %}

I tried pointing it at different databases on the same server and it worked just fine. I finally remembered that one of the tables in the database made use of spatial types. I experimented by deleting the tables which made use of the coordinates and all of a sudden things started working!

Obviously deleting the table wasn't a great solution so I pulled in the required packages which I think are

```
Install-Package microsoft.SqlServer.Types
Install-Package System.Spatial
```

I was now able to access the tables as expected.
