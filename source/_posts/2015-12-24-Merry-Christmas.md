It's been a banner year for the [Western Devs](http://www.jibjab.com/view/gVZz5V5MSnuo1O4-Betp7w) as we emerged from the shadows of a private message board to the spotlight of [public life](http://www.jibjab.com/view/jmlenwe2RN6b-JePc97m4Q). So from all of us, we wish everyone a very Merry Christmas, [Feliz Navidad](http://www.jibjab.com/view/1Py9A_hTTLSZGMTEmEAZuA), and a very happy holiday season.
