I really hate assembly binding and redirects and the such in .net. Any time I see a fatal error message like 

```
Could not load file or assembly 'FSharp.Core, Version=4.3.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)
```

I want to quit programming and become a baker. Yeah I would have to get up early but I would rarely encounter 

```
Could not leven bread using yeast 1.0.4.5 or one of it's dependencies
```

Anyway while trying to use the bulk loading feature I was having a problem because my F# project was referending FSharp.Core 4.4.0 and the C# project I had consuming the F# api was using 4.3.0. I solved it by installing the correct version of the dll in the C# project

```
Install-Package fsharp.core
```
