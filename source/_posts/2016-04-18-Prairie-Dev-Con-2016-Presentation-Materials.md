If you don't know by now, [we love Prairie Dev Con](http://www.westerndevs.com/conferences/Prairie-Dev-Con-What-you-need-to-know/) at Western Devs. And if you attended last week, hopefully you saw why. It's a high quality conference in a most unlikely setting. Here are the materials from each of my presentations.

### Death to the Batch Job

In addition to the slides, you can find the source code for the presentation [here](https://github.com/andreasohlund/DeathToTheBatchJob). There's also a [blog post](http://particular.net/blog/death-to-the-batch-job) that expands a little on the ideas.

### Docker

The two sample apps I showed during the presentation are:

- [AzureCodeCamp](http://github.com/stimms/AzureCodeCamp)
- [GenFu](https://github.com/MisterJames/GenFu)

For the first, I showed how to connect the app to PostgreSQL which can be running either locally or in Docker. For the second, I showed how to create a container for a .NET Core application running in Linux. If you want to play with this container, you can get it [here on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kbaley/genfu/).

### Pre-game Show

In addition to the presentations, [Donald](http://localhost:4000/bios/donald_belcham/) and I (but mostly me), with the help of the Winnipeg .NET User Group, hosted a fishbowl discussion and an evening of drinks and food the night before the conference courtesy of Particular Software. During the talk, we covered ways to build a solid team, the importance of company culture, and good ways to vet people. It was a great chat and it was nice to see so many people weigh in with their experience.

### I'd like to thank...

It's hard to overstate the value this "big little conference" has for me. It has all the benefits of a larger conference while still being accessible to both the attendees and speakers. [D'Arcy Lussier](http://localhost:4000/bios/darcy_lussier/) is a force to be reckoned with in the conference circuit.

Many thanks to the [Winnipeg .NET User Group](http://www.winnipegdotnet.org/) for their help with the fishbowl event.

Finally, a big thank you to those of you who came to the the conference itself and continue making it great.
