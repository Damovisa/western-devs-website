Amir started his career in 1994 working for IBM as a senior developer while he was finishing his Masters degree in computer science. Since then he worked as team leader and architect for the past 15 years.

Having started with languages like C++ and Java he spent many years coding in C# and training other developers in topics such domain modelling, abstractions, patterns, automation, dependency injection, testing, etc.

Being an incurable geek, always thirsty for knowledge, his passion for technology moved him towards Ruby on Rails (RoR) a few years ago, becoming an advocate of RoR web development.

Looking for new ways of sharing his knowledge and helping others to achieve their goals motivated Amir to become an owner and build an agile project management tool called [SmartView](http://smartview.io) that was released in 2014.

Amir is an avid participant and collaborator of the software community. He orginizes ([Coffe and Code](http://www.meetup.com/wpgcoffeecode/)) weekly, participates in multiple user groups ([.NET](http://winnipegdotnet.org), [Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/winnipegrb), [Agile](http://www.meetup.com/agilewpg/), [JVM](http://www.meetup.com/theWfPG/) and [FunProg](http://www.meetup.com/theWjPG/)), presents in  [conferences](http://bit.ly/abarylkopresentations) and has been hosting the [Global day of coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org) since 2011.

Also he as been awarded the Microsoft MVP award in the area of _Application Lifecycle Management_ since 2012.
