Justin Self is a born and raised Texan. As a software developer, he has built online banking applications, peer to peer lending platforms, Fortune 100 e-commerce platforms and a slew of apps in between. As a Principal Solution Architect for Clear Measure, his focus lately has been on distributed .NET systems.

He didn't take the traditional developer route. He originally started out as a theater major. Once realizing that meant he would be a waiter for the rest of his life, he dropped out and became a traveling banker which obviously lead to a fruitful career in software.

Outside of work, he can be found in his garage pretending to be a woodworker or going on adventures with is wife and two year old son. Justin attempts to maintain a blog at [www.justinself.com](http://www.justinself.com).
