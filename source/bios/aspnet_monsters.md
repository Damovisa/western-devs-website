The ASP.NET Monsters are here to explain everything they know about ASP.NET Core and the new version of the MVC Framework, known as ASP.NET Core MVC. Once or so per week Dave, James and Simon [publish a new, short video](https://aspnetmonsters.com/) about some aspect of ASP.net in their own, monstrous, style.
