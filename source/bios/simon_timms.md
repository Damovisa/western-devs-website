Simon Timms is always interested in improving himself and learning all that he can. He has worked in various oil and gas domains as well as insurance and enterprise search. He began his career working with build systems so is very passionate about proper builds and is excited by the burgeoning DevOps movement. For the most part Simon works in C# mostly on web applications. Somehow he seems to have picked up a reputation for knowing about JavaScript. He is a big fan of ReactJS and currently dislikes knockoutjs, but that will likely change in a day or two. Check back soon!

Simon holds an honours degree in computing science from the University of Alberta and a masters in information systems from Athabasca University. Simon believes in community and giving back for all of his good fortune. He helps run the [Calgary .net User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Calgary-net-User-Group/) where he typically talks several times a year. He also talks whenever he can at technical conferences. He is a two time ASP.net MVP and blogs at [Simon Online](http://blog.simontimms.com).
